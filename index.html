          Goal 6 of the United Nations' sustainability goals is to ensure
          availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
          Sadly, the world's water ecosystems are being degraded at an alarming
          rate, with approximately 85% of the planet's wetlands lost over the last
          300 years. The quality of water is unknown for at least 3 billion people
          worldwide due to a lack of monitoring.
