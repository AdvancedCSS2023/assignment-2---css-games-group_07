          Turn over two cards: On each turn, the player clicks on two cards to
          turn them over. If the cards match, the player gets to keep them and
          turn over two more cards. If the cards do not match, they are turned
          back over and the player must remember where they are for future
          turns.

        <li class="how-to-play__step">
          Keep playing until all pairs are matched: The game continues until all
          3 pairs of matching cards have been found. The player's goal is to
          find all the matching pairs in as few turns as possible, with fewer
          turns indicating better memory and performance.
